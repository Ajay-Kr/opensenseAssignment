Problem 2: Given an array of N integers, print the product of the numbers present in the array.
            Input: 
              The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
              Each test cases consists of two lines, the first line containing N, the number of elements, and the second line containing N integers.
            Output
              For each test case, print the required answer in a single line.
            Constraints
              1 <= T <= 100
              1 <= N <= 10
              0 <= A[i] <= 15
